Most people today can’t shut up.

It doesn’t matter what they’re talking about, they’ll let you know about it.

A recent promotion.

A hot date.

Or even the weather.

Whatever it is, people will always tell others too much.

This may seem fine on the surface, but it isn’t.

You shouldn’t tell people everything.

Especially your plans.

When you tell people things without a filter, you’re putting yourself in a vulnerable position.

The person you’re speaking to may appear to be a friend.

But in truth, they could be a secret enemy.

How many marriages have ended because of an affair with a “best friend”?

How many lives have been ruined by unexpected betrayals?

The uncomfortable answer is:

A lot.

Endlessly running your mouth to everyone is stupid.

It doesn’t matter what the content is.

If you have a habit of speaking without thinking, you’ll one day reveal sensitive information to someone who shouldn’t hear it.

Imagine if James Bond didn’t have the power to conceal his intentions.

He’d have been annihilated by Blofeld in minutes.

If you never want to reveal all your secrets, don’t let your tongue run wild everytime you speak to people.

If you do this, it will be very hard for anyone to conspire against you.

Never reveal your hand.

Why do you think politicians are so cryptic?

They know everyone’s out to get them and even their friends could quickly turn into enemies.
